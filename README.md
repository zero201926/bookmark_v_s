## user stories
As a time-pressed user
So that I can quickly go to web sites I regularly visit
I would like to see a list of bookmarks

The website will have the following specification:

Show a list of bookmarks
Add new bookmarks
Delete bookmarks
Update bookmarks
Comment on bookmarks
Tag bookmarks into categories
Filter bookmarks by tag
Users are restricted to manage only their own bookmarks
